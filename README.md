# FredBet #

Simple football betting application using Spring Boot and MariaDB. You can run the application by issuing the following command:

	mvn install spring-boot:run

The application is available under [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and runs (by default) with an in-memory H2 database. Log in with the admin account `admin/admin`.

## Running within Docker ##

	mvn clean install docker:build
	docker run -d -p 8080:8080 fred4jupiter/fredbet

This will build (and run) an image with name `fred4jupiter/fredbet`. In the `dev` profile (which will be activated if no profile is specified) the application starts with an embedded in-memory H2 database.

## Running within Docker Compose##

There is a docker compose file available to run the application with a MariaDB database in one docker container and the application in another. For that run

	cd src/docker/docker-compose/mariadb
	docker-compose up -d

The application is available under [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
